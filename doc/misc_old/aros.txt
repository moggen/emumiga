AROS Concerns
=============

To implement direct object mapping for AROS host following considerations
must be handled:

Object mapping from two ways; both virtual from 68k space and real from
native CPU space.
Virtual 68k adresses should be a separate space from real addresses
to guarantee compatibilty with >32 bit CPUs.
Each mapping should have a reference count so entries can be cleaned up
when they are no longer in use.
