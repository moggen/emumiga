  AROS Public License, version 1.1 or later (APL1.1+)
AND
  GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 or later (LGPL2.1+)

Dual licensing means for this program that anyone that wants to use,
modify or distribute all or parts of this program can choose the best
suiting license of APL1.1+ or LGPL2.1+ and must follow the terms described
in that license. Choosing only one license disables the other license and
references to the disabled license in code and documentation may be removed.
This text paragraph should be removed at the same time. It is also permitted
to keep this exact dual licensing. The copyrights are not affected by
selecting only one license and remain in full.
